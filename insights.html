            <h2>Let’s Talk: Family Enmeshment & Well-being</h2>
            <p class="inviting-intro">Welcome! My research invites us to explore family enmeshment,not just as a
                challenge, but as a complex, culturally nuanced experience. Let’s start a conversation about how close
                family ties can both support and sometimes complicate a child’s emotional growth.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What is Family Enmeshment?</strong> Deep emotional bonds and blurred boundaries between
                    family members.</li>
                <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Strong support, loyalty, and shared values. In some cultures, close-knit
                    families are a source of pride and resilience.</li>
                <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Children may struggle to develop independence, feel pressure to meet family
                    expectations, or have difficulty expressing their own needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural Context:</strong> Enmeshment can be positive or negative depending on family
                    values, traditions, and community norms.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="conversation-starter">
                <em>How do we balance togetherness and independence in our families?</em>

                <li>High anxiety about disappointing family members</li>
                <li>Suppressing personal interests or friendships</li>
                <li>Frequent mood changes or withdrawal</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="callout positive-callout">
                <strong>Remember:</strong> Close family ties can be a source of strength! The goal is to nurture both
                connection and healthy boundaries.
